E-Commerce Web Application  Documentation & Report

1. #######################################  Application Structure #################################

The project follows a well-structured architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Below is an overview of the main directories and their purposes:

Root Level Directories and Files:

.git/: Contains version control files for Git.

.vscode/: Stores Visual Studio Code workspace settings.

node_modules/: Houses installed dependencies managed by npm.

package.json: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

package-lock.json: Ensures deterministic dependency versions.

public/: Holds static assets such as images, favicon, and the main index.html.

README.md: Provides documentation about the project.

src/ - Main Source Directory

This directory contains all application logic, structured as follows:

############################### Components:  ###########################################

Located in src/components/, these are the building blocks of the UI, categorized as:

Cart Components (Cart/):

      CartItem.js: Displays individual cart items.

      CartList.js: Manages the list of added products.

      CartSummary.js: Shows total price and checkout button.

Items Components (Items/):

     ProductCard.js: Displays product information such as image, name, price, and an “Add to Cart” button.

     ProductList.js: Fetches and lists products dynamically.

Layout Components (Layout/):

     Header.js: Navigation bar with categories and user authentication options.

     Footer.js: Displays site-wide footer information.

## UI Components (UI/): integration

     Button.js: Reusable button component.

     Modal.js: Handles pop-up dialogs.

     InputField.js: Standardized input component.

#Redux Store Management:
   Located in src/redux/, this directory contains state management logic using Redux Toolkit.

   Slices (Slices/):

        WishListSlice.js: Manages wishlist-related state, such as adding and removing products.

#Store Configuration (Store.js):

     Initializes the Redux store and integrates reducers from various slices.

*Entry Point Files:

 App.js: Main component where routing and state management are integrated.

 index.js: Entry point that renders the App component inside root.

 index.css: Global styles for the application.

2. ############################################################  Component Usage

The application is designed to be modular, making it easy to extend and maintain. Below is a breakdown of key components:

#Cart Functionality

     Allows users to add, remove, and modify products in the cart.

     Displays item quantity, total cost, and checkout options.

     Uses Redux for state persistence.

Product Display and Selection

Fetches products dynamically from an API or JSON server.

Includes filtering by category, brand, size, and price.

Allows adding items to a wishlist.

####### User Authentication

Implements sign-in and sign-up features.

Uses JWT-based authentication for security.

Persists user sessions across visits.

3. ###################################### API Integration ##########################################

The application integrates APIs for data retrieval, and cart management.

API Usage in Redux

     Redux Toolkit handles API calls using createAsyncThunk in slices.

     WishListSlice.js may use APIs to fetch and manage wishlist items.

     Future improvements can include separate API service files.

Authentication API

     Uses JWT for user authentication.

     Products and Cart APIs

     Fetches product data from an API endpoint.

     Sends POST requests to update cart contents on the server.

     Stores order details for checkout confirmation.
